      <p>
        I have a lot of different projects done from the start of my developer
        carrier. Some of them I'll put on this page. On Frontend side I use
        React + TypeScript. On backend NodeJS. I have experience with Angular,
        PHP, jQuery, Backbone, but now I prefer to avoid work with them.

export default Portfolio
